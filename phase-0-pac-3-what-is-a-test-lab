Let's break this down a bit. If you look about a third of the way down in the output, you'll see a summary of how the tests went:

  1 passing (552ms)
  2 failing
Great! We've already got one test passing! Now let's see how we failed the other two tests.

  1) what-is-a-test
       Name
         returns "Susan":

      Error: Expected 'Joe' to equal 'Susan'
      + expected - actual

      -Joe
      +Susan

      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:6:26)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)

  2) what-is-a-test
       Height
         is less than 40:
     Error: Expected 74 to be less than 40
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toBeLessThan (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:156:28)

While there is no hard and fast rule, and there will be exceptions, it is most often best to address your test errors in order. So let's take a look at our first error:

1) what-is-a-test
       Name
         returns "Susan":

      Error: Expected 'Joe' to equal 'Susan'
      + expected - actual

      -Joe
      +Susan

      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toEqual (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:81:30)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:6:26)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
Here is the specific error:

      Error: Expected 'Joe' to equal 'Susan'
      + expected - actual

      -Joe
      +Susan
